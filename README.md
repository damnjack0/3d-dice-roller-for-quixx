# 🎲 The "I'm Not Cheating" Dice Roller
A 3D, physics-based dice rolling app built to settle disputes, prove my innocence, and look good doing it.

### 📜 The Origin Story
This project exists for one reason and one reason only: **My friends didn't trust my rolls.**
After a particularly lucky streak on game night, accusations were thrown. Words like "loaded dice" and "sleight of hand" were used. I decided that if I couldn't win their trust with my honor, I would win it with **Cold. Hard. JavaScript.**
This app was forged in the fires of dispute resolution. It features transparent probabilities, a permanent history log, and 3D physics that cannot be bribed.

### ✨ Features (a.k.a. Anti-Cheat Measures)
  * **True 3D Physics:** The dice actually bounce. If I roll a 12, it's because gravity said so, not because I clicked a hidden button.
  * **The "Receipts" (History Log):** A persistent session log that tracks every single roll.
    > *"Wait, did you roll a 6 or a 5 three turns ago?"* -\> **Check the logs, Kyle.**
  * **Probability Calculator:** An integrated modal showing the exact odds of rolling a 7 vs. a 2, so we can all argue with data instead of feelings.
  * **Vibrant "Matte-Plastic" Aesthetics:** Because if we're going to nerd out over dice, it should at least look pretty.

### 🛠️ Tech Stack
  * **Core:** React & Three.js (Fiber/Drei)
  * **Physics:** Cannon.js
  * **Vibe Check:** 100% Passed

### 🏆 Credits

**The Builder**
  * **Damnjack0:** For refusing to let an accusation slide and over-engineering a web app just to prove a point.

**The Architect**
  * **Gemini:** For writing the React code and teaching Damnjack0 about "Specular Roughness" after a board game party that went on till 4am.

**The Inspiration (The Haters)**
  * **The "Friends":** You know who you are. Thank you for your skepticism. Without your total lack of faith in my integrity, this beautiful app would never exist.
